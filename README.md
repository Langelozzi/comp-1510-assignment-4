## Game Description
We have created a text based adventure game called 'Reign of Fire'. This game takes place in the dungeon of a 
medieval castle based in the 14th century. Your goal is to defeat the God Kind Thompson and rekindle the fire of 
humanity. We wish you the best of luck on your quest!

## Game details
- The game includes a variety of challenges, from enemy battles, to riddles, to room roadblocks
- In order to complete the game and defeat the king, you must first defeat both of his royal subordinates, indicated 
  on the map by red X's
- The kinds royal subordinates each possess a powerful relic that you must acquire before facing the God King Thompson
- If you die during your quest, you will not lose any items you have gained, but you will be returned to level 1, 
  and you must restart from position (1, 1)

  forcing us to disobey the pycharm syntax warning for line length
